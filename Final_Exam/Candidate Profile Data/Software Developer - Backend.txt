aug'11 role: test lead  description: the most important physical asset of all retailers is inventory. an accurate amount of inventory can make the business just as fast as incorrect inventory can ruin it. 'allocating' this inventory accurately is a critical process as it ensures that the retailer has \"the right amount of the right products in the right places at the right time\".  the main challenges all retailers face while allocating products are identical, irrespective of whether they trade fashion items or groceries or whether they have a single store or five thousand stores. they fancy a well-organized, perfect method of translating their complicated merchandise plans into store level allocations.  effectively allocating products is a vital step in the product life cycle management as this is the last chance the retailer gets to send the right product to the right location. if this allocation of goods is done properly, it ensures that the correct amount of the products land up in the right places. on the other hand, if it is done poorly, it can lead to stock outs and lost sales for some items while other items incur high levels of inventory costs by sitting on the shelves of stores and warehouses resulting in consequent returns or clearances.  roles and responsibilities:  a key member in the following activities:   handling bundle hot fixes and patch releases  handling a 3 member team  analyzing the scoped bugs and preparing the test scenarios.  create system test cases and executing them  bug reporting and tracking  create regression test cases and executing them  executing integration test cases  preparing application reference manual  giving kt to new team members  project # 3: integration manager  client: dun & bradstreet database server: oracle 9i team size: 20 duration: may'07 -
